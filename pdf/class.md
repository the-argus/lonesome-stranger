# Lonesome Stranger: 5e Class

*The stranger walks the roads of the wasteland, his horse dead and eaten for
dinner more than five days ago.  He is alone.  Cresting a hill, the stranger
sees a group of five figures on horseback riding his way.  Their black mounts
are decorated in a way that only scavengers have a taste for: the valuables and
bones of defeated enemies hung on their sides like armor.  Wind whistles through
the sand and scrap.  The stranger flings his dull blue serape over his shoulder,
a cloud of devil-dust roused from where it sat on his rough spun clothing.  His
boot-heels dig into the world beneath him and A silver barrel glints from the
holster at his waist.*

### Mysterious Wanderer

A lonesome stranger is a mystery, first and foremost.  A gun may rest at the hip
of these wandering folk, but their quest is not to increase their might.  They
live in the shadow of a foreboding hooded cloak or a dusty hat, using the air of
mystery that surrounds them to watch from the sidelines and jump into the action
when they see fit.  Most lonesome strangers travel across continents and worlds,
never becoming attached to anything, but a stranger could live in a single city
if they liked.  The one thing that they must avoid is becoming a familiar face.

### Gunslinger

Mysterious folk to most, but mythological figures to some.  Those who know of
the arcane power of the gun may seek out a lonesome stranger.  The seeker of the
gun could be many things: persistent, overconfident, and power-hungry, or
knowledge-seeking, scheming, and dangerous.  Whatever the seeker believes,
whatever they ultimately seek and by what means, they will not be disappointed
by the power of the gun in the hands of a lonesome stranger.  Runes etched on
the surface of the gun, and the power of something ancient buried within it.
The skilled fingers of the stranger bring devastating accuracy.

### Notes for DMs with Lonesome Stranger players

Be aware of the following, if they apply to your player:

* [Where The Water Tastes Like Wine](#where-the-water-tastes-like-wine) and
other [Traveler](#traveler) features may result in your player asking some
remarkably specific questions about the terrain.
* [The Marksman](#the-marksman) is a subclass which uses a rifle. Currently
unfinished. All other subclasses *must* use a six-shot [revolver](#the-revolver)
for features relating to their gun to take effect.
* [The Wildfire Table](#wildfire-table) contains potential wild magic outcomes
from a bullet fired from an overheated gun. Consider altering the contents of
this table if you deem them too "funny."

## Creating a Lonesome Stranger

A lonesome stranger most often is a person who struggles to be attached to the
people and world around them.  This can be a perfect block to sculpt a character
from, but it can be limiting.  Come up with a unique or interesting character as
you normally would, while keeping in mind what this character sheet is best for:
a mysterious figure.  A folk hero might continue to live in the shadows, even if
they are showered in praise when they go into town.  A noble might secretly go
out on adventures to escape the prim and proper.  Lonesome strangers are often
lonely (surprise), but perhaps there is an explanation.  Do they distance
themselves to protect those they love?  Do they have a secret they must hide, or
a past that makes them resent others?  Why are they working with others?  Did
they realize that there are bigger things than wandering and running?  Are they
practical, only working with others for the safety?

### Quick Build

You can make a lonesome stranger quickly by following these suggestions.  First,
make dexterity or charisma your highest scores, favoring the former if you want
an emphasis on gunslinging, and the latter if you desire the social aspects and
spellcasting of the stranger.  Prioritize constitution if you plan to be a short
ranged gunslinger, wisdom and/or intelligence if you want to be a hunter/tracker
akin to the ranger, or strength if you want to use strength-based melee weapons
along with your gun.

### Mysterious Wanderer

Double your proficiency on all performance, deception, and intimidation checks
against creatures who first heard you speak in the last 10 minutes.  If you are
not proficient, you gain your normal proficiency bonus.  You only have this
bonus once against a given creature, successful or not.

### Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even
if you later get to choose again.

#### “Archery”

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Close Quarters Shooter

You are trained in making ranged attacks at close quarters. When making a ranged
attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have
disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and
three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. Finally, you have a
+1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.

### The Way of the Gun

Use of your firearm has caused your mind to be filled with arcane knowledge, and
your dreams with terrible visions.

The lonesome stranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
lonesome stranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells,
you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell ensnaring strike and have a
1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast ensnaring strike
using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the lonesome stranger spell list.

The spells known column of the lonesome stranger table shows when you learn more
spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
lonesome stranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
lonesome stranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability / Spellcasting Modifier

**Charisma** is your spellcasting ability for your lonesome stranger spells. You
use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
lonesome stranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

### Lonesome Stranger Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your
understanding of the way of the gun. Choose Gunslinger, Daemon Killer,
Duel Artist, Traveler, or Runeslinger, all detailed at the end of the class
description. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again
at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Onlooker

At 4th Level, you fully appreciate the power of watching and waiting.  You add
your proficiency bonus to investigation checks related to creatures who are
unaware of you.  You also gain advantage on intimidation rolls against surprised
creatures.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.

### Wildfire

At 5th level, your skilled hands can successfully load bullets into an
overheated gun and not take damage.  Loading a bullet into an overheated gun
will cause the effects described in the weapons stats.  In the case of
revolvers, it is arcane overcharge, the effects of which are described in the
“The Revolver” entry of this document.

### Quickdraw

When you reach 6th level, you add your proficiency bonus to your initiative.

### Nimble Fingers

When you reach 7th level, you can reload three bullets as a bonus action.

### Flew Too Close To The Gun

At 8th Level, you gain a +2 bonus to all attacks against all flying creatures.
On a successful attack, the creature will suffer normal damage, lose control of
their flight and fall ten feet before regaining it, and must make a dexterity
saving throw with DC 8 + your dexterity modifier.  On a failed save, the
creature drops any one-handed items they were holding.  Magically held items,
items in packs, or items strapped to belts can not be dropped.

### Cover Specialist

At 9th level, you ignore all half cover and disadvantage created by a creature
falling prone.  When you are in half cover, it counts as ¾ cover and being prone
counts as half cover (in addition to the normal effects of being prone).

### Dead Man’s Gun

At 11th Level, you gain bonus damage equal to 1d6 + your dexterity modifier on
all attacks against a creature who has knocked you or a friendly PC unconscious
in the last minute.

### Invigorating Kill

At 13th Level, two of your bullets are magically and instantly reloaded when you
deal a killing blow.  This acts as if you reloaded the bullets manually,
allowing you to choose any types of bullets or effects you would have applied.
If you brought the creature you killed from maximum health to 0 in one shot, the
shot does not use an action and you may fire again, up to two more times for a
total of three shots.

### Dextrous Reload

At 15th Level, your nimble fingers can reload six bullets in a bonus action.

### Holy Rounds

At 18th Level, you crit on an attack roll of either natural 19 or 20.

### Bullet Prison

At 19th Level, you begin to realize the full potential of your gun.  You can use
this feature only when your gun is not overheated.  When this feature is
activated at the cost of one lonesome stranger spell slot of 5th level or above,
runes, once invisible, begin to glow blue on the cylinder of your gun.  You fire
six ghostly bullets at a single target without using any ammo.  The bullets form
ethereal chains which encircle a single creature of your choice, and they must
make a wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 12 + your spellcasting modifier +
the level of the spell slot used to cast it.  While affected by this spell, the
creature doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination
spells can’t locate or perceive the target.  The creature cannot target spells
or attacks on anything except itself.  It is considered restrained, and must
make a strength or dexterity saving throw each turn with a DC equal to 12 + your
spellcasting modifier.  It cannot crit, so the spell serves as a permanent
prison against creatures whose strength or dexterity bonus, +20, is less than
12 + your spellcasting modifier + the spell slot level.  Your gun reaches its
overheat threshold after using this feature if it wasn’t already there, and you
must complete a long rest to use this feature again.

### Eyes of an Old God

At 20th level, you have become the ultimate vessel of the gun. Once on each of
your turns, you can add your Charisma modifier to the attack roll or the damage
roll of an attack you make against a creature targeted by this feature. You can
choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of
the roll are applied.  You can only target one creature at a time, and must
complete a short or long rest before choosing a new target.

### Lonesome Stranger Archetypes

The lonesome stranger is a creature of mystery.  Will you draw quickly, eyes and
revolver blazing?  Or perhaps you will watch your opponents approach, calmly
loading your rifle.

#### The Gunslinger

The gunslinger is the silent killer. They are short ranged, but they easily make
up for it with extreme speed with their hands and deadly accuracy.  This is one
of the classic lonesome stranger archetypes, focused on accuracy and power with
your weapon.

Level | Feature
-:|:-
3rd | Steady Hands
7th | Sun’s Zenith, Additional Fighting Style
10th | Omega Bullets
15th | Focus
18th | Picked Clean

##### Steady Hands

Your proficiency bonus with revolvers can be doubled once a turn, if your gun is
not overheated.

##### Sun’s Zenith

The sun aids your watchful eye.  In broad daylight, you ignore all cover and you
can choose to add your charisma to perception checks, in place of wisdom.

##### Gunslinger Additional Fighting Style

At 7th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style feature.

##### Omega Bullets

The final bullet fired from a cylinder gains a +2 to hit and bonus damage equal
to your lonesome stranger level, if the cylinder has not been reloaded since it
was full.

##### Focus

You can choose to attack only once in a turn, which gives you advantage on your
attack and allows you to add your dexterity modifier to the damage.

##### Picked Clean

You can take an opportunity attack against creatures who are moving out of your
line of sight.

#### The Daemon Killer

This gun wielder feels the ancient, godly power of their gun and embraces it,
becoming an agent against all that is unholy.  This archetype is similar to the
gunslinger but it offers an arcane edge in exchange for the raw power of the
gunslinger’s skills.

Level | Feature
-:|:-
3rd | Destruction of the Forces of Evil, Holy Retribution
7th | Skeletal Ward, Learn Branding Smite Spell, Devil-Tongue
10th | Despoiler of Cadaver
15th | Bane of Gundead
18th | Purifier

Daemon Killer Saving Throws DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

##### Destruction of the Forces of Evil

At 3rd Level after choosing this archetype, you gain a particular power against
undead and demonkind.  You gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track
undead, fey, or fiend, advantage on Intelligence checks to recall information
about them, and learn the spell Protection from Evil and Good.

##### Holy Retribution

Your eyes flare with revenge and the power of something ancient.  Once per turn,
you can add your proficiency bonus in radiant damage to attacks against the
creature that most recently dealt damage to you, if your gun is not overheated.

##### Skeletal Ward

At 7th Level: You begin to access an old magic, unknown to people not of the
gun.  The bone of a defeated undead, fey, fiend, or celestial can be held as a
charm against the same type of creature.  Using the bone by holding it out
towards a creature of the correct type of your choice will force the creature to
make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save the bone will disintegrate, and
deal 1D6 radiant/necrotic damage (radiant against undead and fiends, necrotic
against fey and celestial).  The creature is blinded for one round of combat or
six seconds.  You can then choose one of a few possible effects.

* Push the creature away from you in a straight line until it hits a solid
object (and takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage, plus an additional d6 every other
level after your 7th lonesome stranger level) or is 40 feet away from you.
* Cause the creature to become frightened for one minute.
* Cause black tendrils to reach from an extradimensional space and bind the
creature, grappling it.  The creature continues to be grappled until, on one of
its turns, it makes a Strength saving throw, or is cut loose. The tentacles have
an hp of 20 and an AC of 13.

##### Devil-Tongue

Demons seep into your dreams.  You are able to speak Abyssal.

##### Despoiler of Cadaver

As an action, when your gun is not overheated, you can expend a spell slot of
second level or higher to fire a pellet of red energy from your gun, which bends
and swerves to reach a targeted defeated creature.  The creature must be dead,
not surrendered or undead.  The creature and all loot and items on the
creature’s body are immediately incinerated as a wave of flaming red energy
encapsulates everything in a 20 foot radius.  Creatures in the radius take 3D8
fire damage if they fail a dexterity saving throw, and half as much on a
successful save.  For each spell slot above 2nd, add 5ft to the radius and
increase the damage by 1d8.

##### Bane of The Gundead

You deal extra radiant damage on undead creatures equal to your proficiency
bonus.

##### Purifier

On a natural attack roll with your revolver greater than 15 against an undead,
fey, or fiend, you may choose to expend a lonesome stranger spell slot to create
an antimagic field with a radius of 10 feet where the bullet lands.  This field
is unmoving and lasts for a number of turns equal to the spell slot expended.

#### The Duel Artist

The duel artist is a charismatic and theatrical individual, and likes to make a
bit of an entrance.  They are skilled at the draw and love a good trickshot.
Focuses more on the performative aspect of being a gunslinger, with a little
extra magic to boot.

Level | Feature

3rd | Gambler’s Luck, Trickshot
7th | Greased Bullets, learn Electric Rounds spell
10th | Coward’s Duel, Trickshot
15th | Three Coffins, Trickshot
18th | Deadeye

Duel Artist Saving Throws DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier

##### Gambler’s Luck

You can reroll natural ones and twos on skill checks and attack rolls.  You must
complete a short or long rest to use this feature again.

##### Trickshot

Choose a trickshot from the list, one for each time the feature is granted.
Each trickshot has charges equal to your charisma modifier, and fully recharges
after you complete a short or long rest.  A trickshot is treated as a normal
attack roll, adding to your overheat score and using any bonuses as normal,
unless stated otherwise.

* Show of Skill: Fire a shot just beside a creature, granting you advantage on
an intimidation check if the shot hits.  The DC to hit is 12.  If the shot
misses, roll a d4.  On a 1-2, the bullet unintentionally hits the target.  On a
3-4, the bullet misses by a long shot, causing the intimidation roll to fail.
* Fan The Hammer: Fire all the shots in your revolver at once, adding two to
your overheat score for each bullet fired.  The attack targets a 30 degree cone,
30 feet long.  A number of the closest creatures equal to the number of bullets
fired in the cone must make a Dexterity saving throw or suffer normal damage.
All the bullets fired by this trickshot take on the damage dice of the weakest
bullet (assuming a creature with no resistances or vulnerabilities) that was in
your chamber at the time of firing.
* Disarm: On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must succeed on a
Strength saving throw or drop 1 held object of your choice and have that object
be pushed 10 feet away from you.
* Dance For Me: You fire a normal attack at the limbs of a creature that can be
tripped.  On a hit, the creature suffers normal damage and must make a Dexterity
saving throw or be knocked prone.
* One Bullet:  You fire a single bullet, which, on a hit, pierces the target and
continues in a straight line.  The bullet stops at 50 feet away from you or once
you fail an attack role on a creature in the path of the bullet.  After piercing
one creature, each of the succeeding attack rolls are made with disadvantage,
but deal normal damage.

##### Greased Bullets

Once a turn, you can fire twice in a single attack, the second attack dealing
half damage and able to be targeted against a different creature than the first
attack.  This feature has a maximum amount of charges equal to your lonesome
stranger level.  You regain all charges upon completing a short or long rest.

##### Coward’s Duel

When a creature makes an opportunity attack on you, you can make one back using
a reaction. You deal half damage on this attack.

##### Three Coffins

On a turn in which you fire and successfully land three bullets, you can fire a
fourth, ethereal bullet, if your gun is not overheated.  This bullet has no
additional properties your ammunition may have and counts as a magical attack,
dealing your normal damage die as force damage.  It does not increase your
overheat value.

##### Deadeye

At 18th Level, tricks no longer satisfy you.  Your nimble fingers instead
delivery perfect accuracy.  Once per turn, you can add your charisma modifier to
an attack roll or a damage roll, if you do not use your move action on that
turn.

#### The Traveler

The traveler is unassuming, just a stranger who always seems to know their way.
The barrel of a gun will meet whoever underestimates them.  This archetype
primarily emphasizes the hunter and survivalist aspect of the lonesome stranger.

Level | Feature
-:|:-
3rd | Traveler’s Sight, Where The Water Tastes Like Wine, Twilight Seeker
7th | The Last Oasis, Defensive Tactics
10th | Horde Destroyer
15th | Additional Fighting Style
18th | Mind’s Eye

Traveler Saving Throws DC: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier

##### Where The Water Tastes Like Wine

You have wandered for so long, and now the uncivilized world welcomes you. Your
favored terrain is all of the following, if no permanent settlement is within a
mile radius of you: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountains, or
swamp.  You can sense when you leave your favored terrain.  You do not gain
knowledge of a settlement if it causes you to lose your favored terrain
benefits.  Your player character only becomes aware of the fact that they are no
longer comfortable in the terrain.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the
following benefits:

* Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.
* Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as
foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
* You can sense events of extreme weather coming a day before they arrive, if
they are naturally occurring.
* When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their
sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.
* You gain advantage on any wisdom or intelligence roll related to finding shelter.

##### Traveler’s Sight

When at the most elevated location in a mile radius you can use your action and
expend one lonesome stranger spell slot to search the region around you for a
creature you have seen before. You can see it if it is present within 1 mile of
you (or 2 miles if you are in your favored terrain).  Seeing it reveals the
creature’s location and grants you advantage on any attempts to track the
creature while you are within the area of effect of this feature.  If the
creature you use this feature on succeeds on a Wisdom saving throw (the spell

##### School of The Gun

At 7th level, you’ve mastered the basics of the gun and begin to specialize your
pursuits.  Choose one of the following schools of gun magic.

###### Ammunition Evocation

With a full action you can enchant up to two of your bullets with various
effects, at the cost of greater overheat.  You may only choose one enchantment
type in an action.

* Frozen Bullets: You can enchant your bullets to deal an extra 1d4 cold damage
and reduce the target’s movement speed by 20 feet for six seconds on a
successful hit.  These bullets increase your overheat by 3.
* Illusory Rounds: These bullets deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage.  These
bullets increase your overheat by 3.
* Homing Bullets: Attacks with these bullets gain +2 to hit.  These bullets
increase your overheat by 3.
* Weightless Rounds: These bullets are unaffected by gravity and have infinite
range as a result.  These bullets increase your overheat by 2.
* Explosive Rounds: These bullets explode in an arcane wave of energy when they
land, pushing the target away from you by 10 feet if they fail a dexterity
saving throw, and any creatures within five feet of the target away from the
bullet by ten feet if they fail a dexterity saving throw.  These bullets deal an
extra 1d4 force damage and increase your overheat by 3.

###### Chaos Gunmancy

You take half damage from the effects of the Wildfire table, your overheated gun
does not take the normal penalty to hit, and your gun’s overheat threshold is
decreased by 4.  All wildfire bullets that do not deal more than normal direct
damage deal an extra 1d6 piercing.  On a roll of 20 on the wildfire table, the
1d6 extra piercing is still used and is doubled.  On a roll of 17, both the
intended target and any creatures in the bullet’s continuing path take the extra
damage.

###### Abgunation

When your cylinder is full and not overheated, you can expend the arcane energy
of all the bullets simultaneously in a bonus action to create one of the
following effects.  Using these features will increase your overheat score by 4
and can (optionally) consume a spell slot.

* Hexagonal Constitution: You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your
Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).  If you choose to use a spell slot, add 1d6 of
temporary hit points for each spell slot level.
* Hexagonal Fortification: You can choose one creature you can see, and their
armor class cannot be less than your armor class +1 for the duration of the
effect.  The effect lasts for 1 minute, and the number of creatures you can
select increases by one and an additional minute is added for each spell slot
optionally consumed by the effect.  This spell can be cast on yourself.
* Hexagonal Hex: You choose one creature you can see and they are given 3
temporary hit points.  If a creature damages the temporary hit points, the
creature takes 3 direct points of force damage.  For each spell slot level
consumed by this effect, add 3 to the temporary hit points and the damage.

###### Arcane Absorption

When you are subjected to a magical spell that allows you to make a saving throw
to take only half damage, you may choose to instead take no damage if you
succeed or half damage if you fail, at the cost of adding the spell’s level to
your overheat.

###### Legend’s Influence

You begin to understand the power of the stories and rumors that have always
circulated around wanderers.  You can expend a lonesome stranger spell slot of
3rd level or higher to assume the form of possibility, the form of what
onlookers think you could be.  One sentient creature of your choice that can see
you must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or become frightened for one minute.
Add another minute for each spell slot level above third.

#### The Marksman

The marksman is a slow and steady fighter, preferring a rifle over a revolver.
Firing single, powerful shots, reloading, firing, reloading, efficiently
killing.  (backburner until rifles are figured out)

### Lonesome Stranger Spell List

Note: For aesthetic effect only, every projectile-based spell appears to be
fired from your gun.  A bullet does not fire with the spell, so it is unchanged.

1st Level Spells: Command, Compelled Duel, Detect Evil and Good, Ensnaring
Strike, Goodberry.

2nd Level Spells: Find Steed, Find Traps, Gentle Repose, Heat Metal, Locate
Animals or Plants, See Invisibility.

3rd Level Spells: Dispel Magic, Daylight, Flame Arrows, Phantom Steed, Remove
Curse, Speak With Dead, Protection From Energy, Water Walk.

4th Level Spells: Banishment, Stoneskin, Locate Creature.

5th Level Spells: Circle of Power, Dispel Evil and Good, Legend Lore,
Planar Binding.

### The Gun

The gun is an ancient tool with many properties and mysteries.  For the purpose
of this class, I will be using the revolver as the main example.  If you wish to
further homebrew other types of guns, try changing around the variables of
range, clip size, overheat, and reload.  Rifles have a longer range and overheat
slower than revolvers, but both have a smaller clip size and take longer to
reload (an action and a bonus action at first, and then just an action with a
reload speed feature, etc).

#### The Revolver

The revolver is the traditional gun, the most versatile gun. Somewhat short
ranged, yes, but small and with incredible potential. Revolvers deal 1D8
piercing and have a range of 100/120. The revolver also has a mechanic called
overheat, which is a value that increases by one each time you fires a bullet
from it, decreases by three for each action you spends not firing it, and has a
threshold above which the revolver is considered overheated (for a standard
revolver, the cap is 6). An overheated revolver deals 1d4 fire damage to any
creature who touches the barrel or cylinder, except the wielder trying to reload,
if they have the wildfire feature. Bullets loaded into an overheated gun become
unstable, charged with the guns sensitive and powerful arcana. Wild bullets
cannot be removed from the gun and will not lose their properties. These bullets
take a penalty to hit equal to 10 minus half the wielder’s total level, or
(10 - (0.5 * l)). However, they receive a potential bonus from the Wildfire
table.  Roll a D20, and the corresponding effect from the Wildfire table is
applied. Reloading a revolver takes an action unless you have a class feature or
magic weapon that increases the reload speed to a bonus action.

A revolver cannot be made mundane with dispel magic or antimagic fields. If
either of those two antimagic effects are used on the weilder, the wielder
cannot cast spells and the revolver loses magical and elemental damage bonuses,
but the overheating mechanic remains along with the revolvers ability to fire
bullets.

#### Wildfire Table

(all effects are additional to the normal damage caused by the bullet, and
cannot be stopped with antimagic fields or dispel magic spells)

Roll | Effect
:---:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1    |The bullet stretches midair and then disappears in a blink of blue light to another plane.
2    |The bullet creates a red tracer line from your gun and an extremely loud bang as it breaks the sound barrier.  Deals an extra 1d6 force damage and make every creature in a mile radius highly aware of your presence.
3    |A ring of fire wreaths the barrel of your gun, and your bullet deals an extra 1d6 fire damage.  You also take 1d4 fire damage, however, and must succeed on a DC 13 constitution save to not drop your gun.
4    |The bullet glows purple and leaves behind a trail of ethereal runes.  A moment after landing, it teleports you to the nearest unoccupied space (to the bullet) that you can occupy.
5    |When the bullets makes contact with something, the bullet, the target, the smoke trail, the gun, and you are all covered in ice almost instantaneously, causing the attack to deal an extra 1d6 cold damage.  This makes you and the targeted creature frozen and considered restrained.  The effect ends in six seconds or if a creature under the effect takes damage (the creatures under the effect are treated separately).
6    |The bullet appears to miss if it hits, and appears to hit if it misses.  (onlookers would see a creature take a bullet to the brain, and continue to act completely unharmed, or a creature look at a bullet hole in the wall and then begin to bleed, etc)
7    |The bullets leaves a trail of fire on the ground beneath it, dealing 1d4 fire damage to you and to anyone who walks through or is hit by the three foot high fire wall.  It dissipates in 10 minutes.  The bullet that created this effect deals normal damage.
8    |An antimagic field with a radius of 30 feet is created around where the bullet lands.  It lasts for 1 day.
9    |The bullets stops time for 12 seconds for whatever it hits.  All other creatures perceive this as if no time had passed.
10   |The bullet fires as normal, and then turns around midair and hits you instead, for half damage.
11   |The bullet increases the intelligence of a creature it hits by 5 points for 1 minute.
12   |The bullet increases the strength of a creature it hits by 5 points for 1 minute.
13   |The bullet increases the charisma of a creature it hits by 5 points for 1 minute.
14   |On a successful hit, you and the target creature swap places.
15   |The bullet moves through the air very slowly and only hits its target if the initial attack roll was successful and the target doesn’t move on its next turn.  If it does hit, it does double damage.
16   |The bullet turns into a thick black tar, blinding any creature it successfully hits until the creature takes an action to remove the tar.  Removing the tar takes no checks.  The bullet does no damage.
17   |The bullet passes through its target as if it were an illusion and continues onwards, only hitting anything in the same path after the first target.
18   |The bullet turns into a bolt of lightning, shocking both you and the target for an extra 1d6 lightning damage.
19   |The bullet will cause its target to be blinded and frightened for six seconds, their eyes covered in a black film and their mind filled with visions of their greatest fears.  From when the bullet leaves the chamber to when the effect ends, everyone in a 50 foot radius of you, including you, is deafened and can only hear disembodied whispering in an ancient language they cannot understand.
20   |The bullet charges in your gun for a moment, before releasing with a flash of energy.  This bullet deals double damage.

#### Lonesome Stranger-Specific Spells

##### Shifting Bullets

Transmutation

Level 1

Casting Time: 1 Bonus Action

Components: S

Duration: 1 minute

You turn a bullet of your choice into a glowing pellet of white dimensional
energy.  This bullet can be selected in your cylinder without any action.  When
the bullet is fired, it adds 2 to your overheat score and blinks into the
ethereal plane and returns, redirected into a critical point on the target’s
body.  The bullet lets you add your spellcasting modifier instead of dexterity
to hit and deals an extra 1d6 piercing damage.  The spell fails if cast in the
ethereal plane of if the affected bullet is brought there before being fired.

###### At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

##### Electric Rounds

Evocation

Level 2

Casting Time: 1 Action

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

If the last two creatures (or remains of creatures) you fired at are within 75
feet of each other, a bolt of lightning flashes from one creature to another,
dealing 2d6 lightning damage to each of them and any creatures in between.

##### True Bullets

Evocation

Cantrip

Casting Time: 1 Action (or a bonus action, if the caster has the Nimble Fingers feature)

Components: V, S

Duration: Instantaneous

You have discovered the truth of the bullets: they are merely foci, a compromise
between the arcane and the physical.  With this cantrip, you use the power of a
gun to manifest glowing pellets in the cylinder of your revolver instead of
reloading.  These bullets behave as normal bullets, but now reloading adds one
to your overheat score.  These attacks count as magical.
